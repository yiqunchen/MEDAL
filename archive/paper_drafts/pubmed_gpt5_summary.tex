\paragraph{GPT-5 performance on PubMed-derived questions.} On an evaluation set of 8{,}530 items (8{,}366 unique questions), GPT-5 achieved an overall exact match accuracy of 0.678 for the three-way label task (Yes/No/No Evidence), with 100\% of responses returned successfully. Accuracy varied across domains, with higher performance in Tobacco, Drugs and Alcohol (0.746; n=169), Lungs and Airways (0.723; n=382), Pain and Anaesthesia (0.721; n=337), Infectious Disease (0.701; n=405) and Cancer (0.696; n=621), and lower performance in Complementary and Alternative Medicine (0.576; n=92) and Health and Safety at Work (0.521; n=48). Accuracy rose monotonically with citation count: 0.591 for [0--5), 0.617 for [5--12), 0.666 for [12--21), 0.721 for [21--39), and 0.791 for [39--1035). A logistic regression using the merged metadata indicated that citation volume is a significant predictor of correctness: per one-unit increase in log(1+citations), the odds of a correct answer increased by 34\% (OR=1.34; 95\% CI: 1.29--1.40). Trends by publication year showed a mild upward slope in binned analyses. Figures and CSV summaries for fields, year bins, and citation bins are provided in the repository for reproducibility.
